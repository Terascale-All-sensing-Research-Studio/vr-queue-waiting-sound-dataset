# VR Data

Our study consisted of two treatments: 
1.	With Notification: In this treatment the participant is informed by the virtual receptionist that there is a problem with the computer system, therefore providing an explanation of the wait. 
2.	Without Notification: In this treatment, the virtual receptionist does not inform the participant on why there is a delay.   

Each of the 30 folders here represents a single participant. The folder is named with a unique 5-character ID assigned to each participant. Within each of these 30 folders there are two subfolders named ParticipantID_NOTIFICATION and ParticipantID_WITHOUT_NOTIFICATION. Here, ParticipantID is the 5-character ID assigned to each participant and NOTIFICATION and WITHOUT_NOTIFICATION indicates whether the participant was informed by the virtual receptionist on the reason for the delay. Within the NOTIFICATION and WITHOUT_NOTIFICATION sub-subfolders are 4 raw CSV files, for a total of 8 raw CSV files per participant. The names and locations of each of these 8 CSV files are as follows:

| Filename |	Location |
| -------- | -------- |
| EyeGazeLog_NOTIFICATION.csv	| ParticipantID/ParticipantID_NOTIFICATION |
| HeadPositionLog_NOTIFICATION.csv	| ParticipantID/ParticipantID_NOTIFICATION |
| LeftHandLog_NOTIFICATION.csv	| ParticipantID/ParticipantID_NOTIFICATION | 
| RightHandLog_NOTIFICATION.csv	| ParticipantID/ParticipantID_NOTIFICATION |
| EyeGazeLog_WITHOUT_NOTIFICATION.csv	| ParticipantID/ParticipantID_WITHOUT_NOTIFICATION |
| HeadPositionLog_ WITHOUT_NOTIFICATION.csv	| ParticipantID/ParticipantID_WITHOUT_NOTIFICATION |
| LeftHandLog_ WITHOUT_NOTIFICATION.csv	| ParticipantID/ParticipantID_WITHOUT_NOTIFICATION |
| RightHandLog_ WITHOUT_NOTIFICATION.csv	| ParticipantID/ParticipantID_WITHOUT_NOTIFICATION |
