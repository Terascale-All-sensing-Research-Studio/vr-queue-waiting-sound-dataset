# Object Names
The EyeGazeLog_WITHOUT_NOTIFICATION.csv and EyeGazeLog_NOTIFICATION.csv found in the [VRData](https://github.com/Terascale-All-sensing-Research-Studio/vr-queue-waiting-sound-dataset/blob/main/VRData/) folder for each participant contains a column titled ObjectName that stores the name of the object being observed. [The Top Down View](#Top-Down-View) provides a bird's eye view of the scene with the ObjectNames for each object. We label the location where the participant spawns as **Participant Spawn Point**.
