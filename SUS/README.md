# System Usability Scale (SUS)

The standard System Usability Scale (SUS) was administered at the end of the study and scaled from 0 to 100 [[1]](#1). The SUS consists of the following questions:

* I like to use this system frequently?
* I find this system to be more complicated than it should be?	
* I think the system is simple and easy to use?	
* I need technical support to use this system?	
* I find the system functioning smoothly and is well-integrated?
* I think there are a lot of irregularities in the system?	
* I think most people can learn this system quickly?
* I find this system to be time-consuming?
* I feel confident while using this system?	
* I think there are a lot of things to learn before I can start using this system?
