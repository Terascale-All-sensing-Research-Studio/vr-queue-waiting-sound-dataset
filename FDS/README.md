# Frustration Discomfort Scale (FDS)

The standard Frustration Discomfort Scale (FDS) was administered at the start and end of the study [[1]](#1). The FDS asks participants to rate their frustration and discomfort through the following questions:

* I need the easiest way around problems; I can’t stand making a hard time of it
* I can’t stand having to wait for things I would like now
* I must be free of disturbing feelings as quickly as possible; I can’t bear if they continue
* I can’t stand being prevented from achieving
* I can’t stand doing tasks that seem too difficult
* I can’t stand it if other people act against my wishes
* I can’t bear to feel that I am losing my mind
* I can’t bear the frustration of not achieving my goals
* I can’t stand doing tasks when I’m not in the mood
* I can’t bear it if other people stand in the way of what I want
* I can’t bear to have certain thoughts
* I can’t tolerate lowering my standards even when it would be useful to do so
* I can’t stand having to push myself at tasks
* I can’t tolerate being taken for granted
* I can’t stand situations where I might feel upset
* I can’t bear to move on from work I’m not fully satisfied with
* I can’t stand the hassle of having to do things right now
* I can’t stand having to give in to other people’s demands
* I can’t bear disturbing feelings
* I can’t stand doing a job if I’m unable to do it well
* I can’t stand doing things that involve a lot of hassle
* I can’t stand having to change when others are at fault
* I can’t get on with my life, or be happy, if things don’t change
* I can’t stand feeling that I’m not on top of my work
* I can’t stand having to persist at unpleasant tasks
* I can’t tolerate criticism especially when I know I’m right
* I can’t stand to lose control of my feelings
* I can’t tolerate any lapse in my self-discipline
* I can’t tolerate being overlooked
* I can’t bear to have been treated unjustly
