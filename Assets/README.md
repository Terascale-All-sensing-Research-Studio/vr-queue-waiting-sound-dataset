# Assets

Our study consisted of two treatments: 
1.	With Notification: In this treatment the participant is informed by the virtual receptionist that there is a problem with the computer system, therefore providing an explanation of the wait. The folder [Sound_Audio_Files](https://github.com/Terascale-All-sensing-Research-Studio/vr-queue-waiting-sound-dataset/blob/main/Assets/Sound_Audio_Files) contains all the audio assets in MP3 format for the With Notification treatment.
2.	Without Notification: In this treatment, the virtual receptionist does not inform the participant on why there is a delay. The folder [No_Sound_Audio_Files](https://github.com/Terascale-All-sensing-Research-Studio/vr-queue-waiting-sound-dataset/blob/main/Assets/No_Sound_Audio_Files) contains all the audio assets in MP3 format for the Without Notification treatment.  

We provide the differences in the audio assets used in each treatment below. **Present** indicates that the audio asset is used in the treatment and **Absent** indicates that the audio asset is not used in the treatment.
