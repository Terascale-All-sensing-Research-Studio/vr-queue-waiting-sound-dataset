* Physical Demand: How much physical activity was required? (Very Low to Very High)
* Temporal Demand: How much time pressure was there? (Very Low to Very High)

* Effort: How hard did you work to achieve the level of performance? (Very Low to Very High)
* Frustration: How stressed and irritated did you feel versus how content? (Very Low to Very High)
