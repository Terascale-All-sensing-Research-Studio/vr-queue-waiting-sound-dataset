# NASA Task Load Index (NASA TLX)

The 21-tick version of the NASA TLX was administered at the end of the study and scaled from 0 to 100 [[1]](#1). The NASA TLX consists of the following questions:

* Mental Demand: How much mental and perceptual activity was required? (Very Low to Very High)
* Physical Demand: How much physical activity was required? (Very Low to Very High)
* Temporal Demand: How much time pressure was there? (Very Low to Very High)
* Effort: How hard did you work to achieve the level of performance? (Very Low to Very High)
* Frustration: How stressed and irritated did you feel versus how content? (Very Low to Very High)
* Performance: How successful was the task accomplished? (Perfect to Failure) 

| Dataset Column | Question | Response Value Range | 
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 1 | Participant ID | Unique 5-character ID assigned to each participant |
| 2 | MentalDemand | 0 - 100 |
| 3 | PhysicalDemand | 0 - 100 |
| 4 | TemporalDemand | 0 - 100 |
| 5 | Effort | 0 - 100 |
| 6 | Frustration | 0 - 100 |
| 7 | Performance | 0 - 100 |
