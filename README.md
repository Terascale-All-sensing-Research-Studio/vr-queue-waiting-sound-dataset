## Description
The dataset consists of 30 participants standing in queue in a virtual doctor’s office receptionist area designed using a Unity 2022.3.9 f1. Each participant stands in the queue for 3-minutes before approaching the virtual receptionist to confirm their doctor’s appointment. Each participant provides data across two treatments, once when the virtual receptionist informs them on why there is a delay and once when the receptionist does not. The reason for the delay is stated as a problem with the virtual receptionist’s computer system. Participants complete both treatments, however, the order of assignment of treatments is randomized. Data is collected from within the VR environment using a Meta Quest Pro. Prior to immersion into the VR environment, participants complete a demographics form and the Frustration Discomfort Scale. After each treatment, participants answer a 3-question survey on the length of delay, their frustration at the delay measured on a 5-point Likert scale, and their likelihood to exit due to the delay, also measured on a 5-point Likert scale. After both treatments, participants complete a second Frustration Discomfort Scale as well as the NASA Task Load Index, System Usability Scale, and Virtual Reality Sickness Questionnaire. Each participant provides data in a single session lasting 1-hour. For each participant we recorded: eye gaze hit locations, objects viewed per timestamp based on the gaze ray intersections with scene objects, headset position and orientation, and left and right hand position and orientation.
